    "type": "Solo-Project",
    "description": "A programming language interpreter is an essential foundational element of many high-level programming languages (ie. JavaScript), allowing the translating and executing of input code. Building this interpreter was definitely one of the most complicated personal coding projects Iâ€™ve done, but also the most interesting and satisfying. It demands a deep understanding of language syntax, semantics, and software architecture to ensure efficient code interpretation. There are many intertwined components that make up the interpreter process, from the lexer, AST, parser, environment, object based value system, to the evaluator. This website was built with a frontend of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Xterm.js, and Highlight.js, and the backend to separate the interpreter logic with Node.js, Websockets, and Express.js. Check out the website to test the interpreter, see the code, and learn what an interpreter is, how it works, and how I built all of this!",
